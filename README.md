 # Conky-Config
A modular Conky configuration

A modular Conky configuration that is being built on your machine based on the actually available hardware without any hardcoded information.
So far supported:
- General hardware information like atchitecture, kernel, CPU temperature and machine uptime
- The # of CPU cores: Up to 6 cores will be shown in 2 columns, above it'll be 6 columns. Current Clock per core is only shown for >=6 cores.
- Networking interfaces: Any interface of status UP or RINNING will be shown, so both cable and wifi should show up and provide detailed information.
- Ping warning: Should pings fail, a bright red text will inform you
